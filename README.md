# prework-website
This website is my prework project. Pulling together self-directed lessons involving setting up my local environment, Git/repositories, using the Command Line, setting up and managing directory's, Github workflow, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and using the DOM.

I can use this as a review of all the prework lessons provided for me. Both for the test given before the live class begins, and as a self-review so that I'm ready for the Live class itself.

Given the above, I'll be attempting to go back over everything and incorporating every lesson into this site.
