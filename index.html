            <p>About the website author:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I am currently a student with the Flatiron School in the Software Engineering Course. I am expected to complete this in November 2021</li>
                <li>I am a former Accountant with about 6 years of experience. Mostly working with a broad spectrum of startup and technology companies.</li>
                <li>The past couple of years have allowed me (along with many others) to really reflect on what I want out of a career. This is what inspired me to seek a career change. I was and am motivated to work on exciting contemporary projects in a direct way using modern technical skills.</li>
                <li>In my down time I can be found reading, cooking, walking, biking, and playing games.</li>
